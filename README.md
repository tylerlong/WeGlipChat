## Motivations

[RingCentral Glip](https://glip.com/) is a great team collaboration tool.
RingCentral offers [Glip Restful API in beta](https://developer.ringcentral.com/api-docs/latest/index.html#!#GlipApi.html).

[WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat) is one of most popular messaging tool in China.
It's especially famous for its ease of use.

I'd like to take advantages of RingCentral Glip API to build a Glip client which is as user friendly as WeChat.

I also want to try something new, such [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
Personally I like things simple and working.
I want to see how simple a project I can manage to produce.
